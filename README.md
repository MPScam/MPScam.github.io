# This is the home page of Camerons githuib for teaching

### These are some things that we will cover this first week. Peruse at your own discretion. I will cover most of the basics and some of the more intermediate and advanced work we will need to do directly.




To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the hierarchy level and typeface size of the heading.


  <h1> 1st level header </h1>
  <h2> 2nd level header</h2> 
  <h3> 3rd level header</h3> 
  <h4> 4th level header</h4> 
  <h5> 5th level header</h5>
  <h6> 6th level header</h6>
   




### You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, strikethrough, subscript, or superscript text in comment fields

Bold, italics, strikethroughs are all doubled expressions immedieately before and after your text
For example:

\*\*bold\*\*

\*italics\*

\~\~strikethrough\~\~

### you can also <sup>Superscript</sup> and <sub>Subscript</sub> your text with :

Subscript	\<sub> \</sub>

&

Superscript	\<sup> \</sup>



### You can quote text with a \>.

Text that is not a quote

> Text that is a quote


### emojis

You can add emojis to your writing by typing \:EMOJICODE:, a colon followed by the name of the emoji.
like this üëç


### images

You can display an image by adding ! and wrapping the alt text in [ ]. Alt text is a short text equivalent of the information in the image. Then, wrap the link for the image in parentheses ().

for example : \!\[a frog]\(https://blog.forestandbird.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/archeys_frog_d_veitch_lrresized.jpg)

shows 

![a frog](https://blog.forestandbird.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/archeys_frog_d_veitch_lrresized.jpg)



### Tables

you can add a list to your page pretty easily

You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with -, *, or +.


\- Dave

\* Mark

\+ Grognar


- Dave
* Mark
+ Grognar

To order your list, precede each line with a number.
