## Tutorial for Wednesday

There are a few things you can do today.
 - [] first is to create a new webpage for the rubric. you will need to make a new repository and an index.html file. you can inspect my one from [here](https://mpscam.github.io/TestHtml/) you can copy my table as it is by pressing crtl + U, or right clicking and choosing "view page source" to copy my table code. THIS MUST BE DONE BEFORE ANY OTHER WORK TODAY. 
   

 once you have created this repo and added it to your website, it would be extremely wise to start tailoring your work to reflect the assessment criteria of the rubric. Please read through the rubric and make sensible choices that will aid you in improving your design choices to make your website as accesible as possible.

some things you can do are to peruse the w3schools link to upskill your css skills to make your pages more dynamically interesting. this link [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) will help you. I recommend looking through the advanced section. 

You may also want to follow [this](https://www.shecodes.io/athena/8356-align-images-horizontally-with-equal-space-in-html-css#:~:text=By%20setting%20the%20parent%20element,equal%20space%20between%20each%20image.) tutorial on how to space images equally apart for you home link + a left/right navigation between your webpages. Remember that the css code needs to go into a
```
<style> </style>
``` 
tag, and the html code needs to go where it will be on your webpage. 

## Tutorial for Thursday

Excellent work to all of you who've been using your time well while I am sick. I have passed on a list to your reliever of those who have yet to add the rubric to your website. Please do that before you move onto anything else. 

For those of you who are starting to make all of your webpages, host your stylesheet.css file in the root of your main website Username.github.io.  You can then call it in each of your new index.html files by using its address, username.github.io/stylesheetname.css
you can look through my frogs webpages to see that all of my css formatting is now all in exactly one file but used everywhere, this means that one change to the stylesheet now affects all webpages. It is much easier to manage this way. 

you may also notice that i have certain elements like all my
```
<p>
```
 tags called in a 
 ```
 <div>
```
 tag. this is what is called a class. if you want certain elements to always be the same like my navigation bar at the bottom of each frog page, you can see that in my stylesheet i have decleared a class with the syntax:
 ```
 .classname {


} 
```

this means that when i call that class in a 
```
<div>
```
tag i can apply those changes just there and then. all my paragraph tags are centered and justified, so that the text is in a consistent band on each screen. These can be very useful if you use them well. Have a experiment if you are feeling adventurous


For those of you who have uploaded your rubric, you have essentially all the skills and relative html know-how to figure something new out on your own. This is a crucial skill for working in a digital space. Almost every problem you will encounter has been solved before, if not in the exact context you are experiencing it. You have the foundation of your website now you just need to build it. 

Please keep a checklist on your homepage, that shows what you have achieved and what is still working/not working. Please also add a small paragraph on your homepage about wgat your chosen topic is that you are making your website about.
