I can make change how text behaves with by beginning and ending my text with symbols

**Bold** uses either double ** or double __
*italics* uses single * or _
~~strike~~ through uses ~~
**I can also *nest* text with ~~different~~ styles * altogether**

i can also make things low with subscript like this : <su> See </sub>
or make it float with superscript like this : <sup> up here </sup>
