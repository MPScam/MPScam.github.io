        The Desert Rain Frog (Breviceps macrops) is a rare species found only along a 6.2-mile wide strip of coastline in Namibia and South Africa.
        It's also one of the rare frogs to go viral, thanks to its squeaky voice. It is nocturnal and buries itself beneath the sand during the day, where it can stay cool and moist,
        then comes out at night to feed on insects and larvae. As reported on Treehugger, "The small strip of the world that they inhabit is prone to sea fog, which keeps the sand moist in an otherwise arid region.
        They have a patch on their bellies that is not only transparent, but has numerous blood vessels and capillaries through which they can absorb water from the sand."

        The frog's specialized habit of burying itself is threatened by human settlement and open-cast diamond mining, and scientists are concerned that the frog's population is declining.
        It's listed as "near threatened" on the IUCN's Red List.
